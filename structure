1. rag_models.py (Data Classes)
This file holds the essential data structures used across the entire project.

2. document_store.py (Retrieval Component)
This handles all operations related to chunking, embedding, indexing, and searching.

3. local_llm.py (Generation Component)
This class handles the local language model for generating the final answer.

4. rag_pipeline.py (Orchestration Component)
This is the "brain" that connects retrieval and generation.
