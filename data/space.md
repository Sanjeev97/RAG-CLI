## The Moon Landing

Apollo 11 was the first crewed mission to land on the Moon. On July 20, 1969, 
astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed the Apollo Lunar Module Eagle.
Neil Armstrong became the first person to walk on the Moon.

His famous words were: "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."

Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the Command Module Columbia.

## The International Space Station

The International Space Station (ISS) is a space station in low Earth orbit.
It orbits at approximately 408 kilometers (253 miles) above Earth.

The ISS has been continuously occupied since November 2000. It serves as a 
laboratory for scientific research in microgravity. Five space agencies 
collaborated to build it: NASA, Roscosmos, JAXA, ESA, and CSA.

## Mars Exploration

Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. NASA's Perseverance rover landed on 
Mars on February 18, 2021. The rover is searching for signs of ancient
