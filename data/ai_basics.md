# Artificial Intelligence Basics

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence where computers learn 
from data instead of being explicitly programmed.

There are three main types:

1. Supervised Learning - Learning from labeled examples
2. Unsupervised Learning - Finding patterns in unlabeled data  
3. Reinforcement Learning - Learning through trial and error

## Neural Networks

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological brains. They 
consist of layers of connected nodes (neurons) that process information.

Deep learning uses neural networks with many layers to learn complex patterns.
This is what powers modern AI like ChatGPT and image recognition.

## What is RAG?

RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation. It's a technique that combines:

1. Retrieval - Finding relevant documents from a knowledge base
2. Generation - Using an AI to generate answers based on those documents

RAG helps AI give more accurate answers by grounding responses in actual 
documents rather than just its training data.
